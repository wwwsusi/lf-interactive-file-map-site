# Lady Fitness Control Center V2 — frontend source

This repository owns the V2 frontend source. The private backend serves a checksum-verified, immutable source revision on the same HTTPS origin as /api/*.

## Source consolidation — prepared, not merged or deployed

This branch is based on main `b91b002bc4eb0314b2281fbf61a5ae2d3dbbc510` and restores the frontend implementation from the backend's observed immutable source pin `805a00aef1b3057e9bda4ef79d738d88ed24021a`. The older `codex/control-center-supabase-v2` branch is not the production baseline.

The backend `service/frontend-pin.json` remains unchanged. Merging this frontend consolidation does not change the backend's deployed shell. Future releases need a separately reviewed pin update and explicit deployment authorization.

## Runtime and data boundaries

- Current operational facts come from the authenticated `/api/dashboard` Supabase projection.
- Browser → same-origin backend → Supabase. No privileged database credentials belong in the frontend.
- Existing login, server session restore, logout, dashboard refresh, validation and freshness/error behavior are retained from the immutable source pin.
- Explicit imports are historical SNAPSHOT data; DEMO uses synthetic data. They never become canonical current state.
- Public builds contain an empty graph, allowlisted code and licensed fonts. Do not commit private business payloads or QA fixtures.
- Business status/lifecycle/category semantics belong to the backend DTO and registry. Source code is not a business master.

## Retired paths remain retired

The Pages publication workflow and current-state Markdown CLI entrypoints `scripts/refresh-now.mjs` / `scripts/enrich-campaign-briefs.mjs` remain removed. Do not restore `/api/report`, Markdown/Sheets current-state runtime or GitHub Pages reporting. Shared historical parser libraries/tests remain offline-only.

The previous owner action to unpublish any existing Pages site is not re-verified here. No Pages setting, backend pin, deployment, schema or auth model is changed by this branch. Earlier documentation remains available in Git history and dated audit evidence.

## Validation

Node.js 22+: `npm run check`, `npm run build`.
Optional synthetic browser QA: `python scripts/qa-session-restore.py` and `python scripts/qa-supabase-browser.py`; inspect their required arguments before running.

Consolidation readback and source hash checks are documented in [migration evidence](Audit%20Results/2026-10-09-v2-main-source-consolidation.md). Runtime tests and browser QA must pass before this draft is made ready; the preparation environment was unavailable.

## Follow-up

LF-TASK-024 UX NOW implementation is deferred until the baseline conflict is resolved. This consolidation includes no UX redesign, CRM, API/schema expansion, merge or deployment and creates no second task register.
